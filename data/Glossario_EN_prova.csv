The nestoride is a distinct form because of its tall side handles. Images of nestorides on southern Italian red-figure vases suggest that nestorides were used primarily as storage vessels like stamnoi or amphorae but there were also smaller nestorides that were similar in function to kantharoi in that they served as drinking vessels.

Use was continued in the Latin Church to about the 14th century, and in the Greek Church to the present day.
